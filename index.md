I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how I'm learning to use GitHub and, hopefully, how it will help me become a better developer :smile:.
My **goal** is to become proficient in coding and land an actual position as a developer :woman: :computer:. What's the saying? Oh, yes:

Learning is fundamental and I can tell that I'm truly going to enjoy doing these labs! :100:
